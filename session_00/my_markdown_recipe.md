# Classic Spaghetti Carbonara


## Ingredients:

- 200g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 3 large eggs
- 50g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale until it becomes crispy and golden. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a pinch of black pepper. Be sure to mix well to create a creamy mixture.

4. Once the spaghetti is cooked, immediately transfer it to the skillet with the cooked pancetta. Toss to combine and coat the pasta with the rendered fat.

5. Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss vigorously to combine, using some of the reserved pasta water if needed to create a silky sauce that coats the pasta evenly.

6. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy carbonara sauce. Be careful not to cook the eggs too much, as you want a smooth and velvety texture.

7. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and additional black pepper if desired.

8. Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with chopped fresh parsley and extra grated Pecorino Romano cheese on top.

Enjoy your delicious Classic Spaghetti Carbonara!
